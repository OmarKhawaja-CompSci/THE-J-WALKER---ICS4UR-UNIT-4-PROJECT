## **THE J-WALKER by Omar Khawaja - 756691**

## Description:
In this game, you are the UFC fighter named JOHNNY WALKER who has just become a world champion. To celebrate, he drinks a juice called JAMIE WALKER, but on his way home, he starts to feel nauseous and dizzy. With his disorientation, he can't figure out which way his home is, so he ends up JAYWALKING forward and back across the street. The only problem is that there are cars on the road. The more lanes he can cross, the more points he gets. Your goal is to score as many points as possible without getting hit.

## Purpose:
This game is a recreation of the classic crossy road game but with a twist. it includes additional features like a login/signup page, images, music and more

## Goals:
The goal of this project is to be submitted as my unit 4 project in my ICS4UR class. This project demonstrates my learning throughout this course including things like file I/O, GUI design, and the log in and sign up page we made in class.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
